# What is Distributed Tracing?
Distributed tracing is a technique used in software development to help identify and debug problems that occur in complex, distributed systems. In a distributed system, different components of an application can run on different servers, in different programming languages, and may communicate with each other using various communication protocols. It involves instrumenting an application to generate trace data, which provides a detailed view of how requests flow through the different components of a system. 

A trace represents a single request and includes information about the components that were involved in processing the request, the time taken by each component, and any errors that occurred along the way. Tools can be used to collect and visualize trace data, making it easier to understand the performance and behavior of a system as a whole. This can help identify bottlenecks, errors, and other issues that might be impacting the overall performance of the application.

## What is Instrumenting?
Instrumenting refers to the process of adding code to an application to collect data about its behavior, performance, or usage. The goal of instrumenting an application is to gain insight into how the application is functioning, to identify and fix issues, optimize performance, and improve user experience.

## What is observability?

Observability is a concept in software engineering that refers to the ability to understand the internal state of a system based on its external behavior. Put simply, an observable system can be monitored, analyzed, and understood from the outside.

Observability is essential in modern software development because it allows developers and operators to gain insight into the behavior of complex, distributed systems. 

In a distributed system, different components of an application can run on different servers, in different programming languages, and may communicate with each other using various communication protocols. Observability tools allow developers and operators to track the flow of requests through the system, monitor system health and performance, and identify and troubleshoot issues as they arise.

- Metrics: collect valuable data regarding KPIs like error rates, latency, and throughput. 
- Traces: tracks each request as it occurs and analyzes the performance of each component that processes the requests.
- Logs: capture data from different components of a system and analyze the information to get insights into the an applications behavior.
- Dependencies: reveals how each component is dependent on other components, apps, and IT resources.
