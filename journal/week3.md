# Setup AWS Cognito
## Create new user pool
- User pools to have login and sign up
- Federated identity providers would use a social identity from another identity provider

NOTE: Required attributes cannot be changed after creating the user pool.

## Install AWS Amplify Library
AWS Amplify will allow us to use Cognito

Documentation: https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/js/

```sh
cd frontend-react-js
npm i aws-amplify --save
```

Adding this as a dependency.
Open `package.json` and we should see `"aws-amplify: ^5.0.16"`
