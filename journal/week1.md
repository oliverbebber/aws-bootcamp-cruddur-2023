# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
## Livestream Technical Tasks
In this class, we are going to:
- [x] Create a new GitHub repo
- [x] Launch the repo within a Gitpod workspace
- [ ] Configure Gitpod.yml configuration, eg. VSCode Extensions
- [ ] Clone the frontend and backend repo
- [ ] Explore the codebases
- [ ] Ensure we can get the apps running locally
- [ ] Write a Dockerfile for each app
- [ ] Ensure we get the apps running via individual container
- [ ] Create a docker-compose file
- [ ] Ensure we can orchestrate multiple containers to run side by side
- [ ] Mount directories so we can make changes while we code

## Required Homework
- [ ] Watch Grading Homework Summaries
- [ ] Watch Week 1 - Live Stream
- [ ] Watch Ashish's Week 1 - Container Security
- [ ] Watch Ashish's Week 1 - Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)
- [ ] Document the Notification Endpoint for the OpenAI Document
- [ ] Write a Flask Backend Endpoint for Notifications
- [ ] Write a React Page for Notifications
- [ ] Run DynamoDB Local Container & ensure it works
- [ ] Run Postgres Container & ensure it works

## Homework Challenges
- [ ] Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script
- [ ] Push and tag a image to DockerHub (they have a free tier)
- [ ] Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build
- [ ] Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
- [ ] Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile
- [ ] Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces
- [ ] Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes.
